There are four main files that the solutions to the problems were answered in: speedrunning.py, genealogy.py, trains_planes.py, and security_routing.py. Each file contains a class with the methods and data structures required to solve the given problem, with the topic ranging from sorting and searching to trees and graph traversal.

You can run instatiate each class and run the methods yourself, or run the unit tests for a class with its corresponding test_<filename>.py with the below instructions:
1. Have both files in the same directory
2. Make sure the name of the solution file is imported at the top of the unit testing file
   e.g import speedrunning
       from speedrunning import *
3. Open a terminal in the directory and execute 'python -m unittest'
